      <b>Answer:</b><br />
      The <meta /> tag in HTML is used to provide metadata about the HTML
      document. It includes information such as character encoding, viewport
      settings for responsive design, keywords for SEO, and more. Here’s an
      example of a <meta /> tag for specifying character encoding:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code></pre>

      <b>Answer:</b><br />
      Progressive enhancement is an approach to web development that focuses on
      providing a baseline experience for all users and then enhancing that
      experience for users with more advanced browsers or devices. It starts
      with a solid foundation of accessible and semantically meaningful HTML,
      and then additional layers of functionality, styling, and interactivity
      are added using CSS and JavaScript.
      <br />
      Graceful degradation, on the other hand, takes the opposite approach. It
      starts with a fully-featured experience and then ensures that the website
      or application still functions reasonably well even in older browsers or
      when certain features are not supported.
      <br />
      Both progressive enhancement and graceful degradation aim to ensure that
      the user experience is not compromised, regardless of the user’s browser
      or device capabilities.

        Explain the concept of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how it
        relates to web development.
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Answer:</b><br />
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and
      XML documents. It represents the structure and content of a web page as a
      hierarchical tree of objects. Each element, attribute, and text node in
      the HTML document is represented as an object in the DOM tree, allowing
      developers to access and manipulate the document’s structure, content, and
      styles using JavaScript or other programming languages. <br />
      The DOM provides methods and properties to dynamically create, modify, or
      remove elements, update styles and classes, handle events, and traverse
      the document tree. It plays a vital role in web development, enabling
      interactive and dynamic web pages through the manipulation of the
      document’s structure and content.
