    <h2><i>Explain the CSS Box Model and its components.</i></h2>
    <p>
      <b>Answer:</b><br />
      <img src="./assets/css-box-model.png" /><br />
      The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how
      elements are rendered and sized in a web page. It consists of four
      components: content, padding, border, and margin. The content area is
      where the actual content of the element is displayed. The padding area
      surrounds the content and provides space between the content and the
      border. The border is a line that goes around the padding and content
      area, and the margin is the space outside the border.

    <h2><i>What is CSS specificity, and how is it calculated?</i></h2>
    <p>
      <b>Answer:</b><br />
      CSS specificity is a set of rules that determines which styles should be
      applied to an element when conflicting styles are present. It is
      calculated based on the combination of selectors used to target an
      element.<br />

      <br />Specificity is calculated by assigning weights to different parts of
      the selector.
      <b>
        Inline styles have the highest weight, followed by IDs, classes and
        pseudo-classes, and elements and pseudo-elements </b
      >. When multiple selectors have the same weight, the last one encountered
      in the stylesheet takes precedence.

      <i
        >Explain the concept of CSS preprocessors and their benefits in CSS
        development. Provide an example of a popular CSS preprocessor and
        explain its key features.</i
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Answer:</b><br />
      CSS preprocessors are tools that extend the capabilities of CSS by adding
      features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions. They allow
      developers to write more modular and maintainable CSS code and provide an
      abstraction layer on top of raw CSS.<br />

      One popular CSS preprocessor is Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets).
      Sass introduces features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and
      more. It provides benefits like code reusability, improved
      maintainability, easier theming, and more concise and readable code.<br />

    <pre>
      <code>
        $primary-color: #007bff;

        .button {
          background-color: $primary-color;
          color: white;

          &:hover {
            background-color: darken($primary-color, 10%);
          }
        }

    <h2>
      <i
        >Explain the concept of object-oriented CSS (OOCSS) and how it can
        improve CSS maintainability and reusability.</i
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Answer:</b><br />
      Object-oriented CSS (OOCSS) is an approach to writing CSS that focuses on
      separating structure (objects) from skin (visual styles). It involves
      creating reusable CSS classes that represent objects or components rather
      than styling specific elements. <br />

      By separating structure and skin, OOCSS promotes code reusability and
      maintainability. Objects can be reused across different elements, reducing
      code duplication. Skin classes provide visual styles and can be applied to
      multiple objects, allowing for consistent styling across the website or
      application.<br />

      OOCSS also enables easier updates and modifications. By isolating
      structure and skin, changes to the visual styles can be made without
      affecting the underlying structure or layout, making maintenance and
      updates more efficient.<br />

    <h2>
      <i>
        Explain the concept of responsive web design and the techniques used to
        achieve it.
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Answer:</b><br />
      Responsive web design is an approach to building websites that ensures
      optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes. It
      involves designing and developing websites that automatically adapt their
      layout, content, and functionality based on the device’s capabilities and
      screen size.
      <br />
      The key techniques used in responsive web design include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fluid Grids: Designing layouts based on relative units (e.g.,
        percentages) rather than fixed units (e.g., pixels) to allow elements to
        scale proportionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexible Images: Using CSS techniques like max-width: 100% to ensure
        images adapt to the container size and avoid overflowing or distorting
        the layout.
      </li>
      <li>
        Media Queries: Applying different CSS styles based on the device’s
        characteristics (e.g., screen width, device orientation) using media
        queries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Breakpoints: Defining specific screen widths at which the layout should
        change to accommodate different devices, and applying appropriate CSS
        rules accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mobile-First Approach: Designing and developing websites starting from
        the mobile layout and progressively enhancing the experience for larger
        screens.
      </li>
    </ul>
