      The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how
      elements are rendered and sized in a web page. It consists of four
      components: content, padding, border, and margin. The content area is
      where the actual content of the element is displayed. The padding area
      surrounds the content and provides space between the content and the
      border. The border is a line that goes around the padding and content
      area, and the margin is the space outside the border.
